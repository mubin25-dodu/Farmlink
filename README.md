Project Description: FarmLink
In Bangladesh, farmers work tirelessly to grow crops, yet when it comes to selling them, they are often trapped by powerful market syndicates. These groups control supply chains, raise prices unfairly, and leave farmers earning only a fraction of what their produce is worth. Meanwhile, consumers and small shop owners pay inflated prices without realizing the struggle behind the market.
FarmLink is a C# .NET-based platform designed to break this cycle. It directly connects farmers with buyers (everyday users or shop owners), allowing farmers to list their products and sell without relying on exploitative middlemen. Users register as buyers, sellers, or farmers. Each user has basic credentials such as name, email, password, role, image, and location.
Sellers (who are also users) can list multiple products with details such as name, description, image, unit price, and quantity. Buyers can browse these products and add them to their cart, from which they can place orders. The cart maintains the buyer-product relationship before placing an order.
When orders are placed, they include product details like quantity, unit price, image, and description. An order is part of an order history for a buyer and includes payment information and status tracking.
However, farmers often face challenges when selling in bulk-they may not have the time, skills, or resources to negotiate large deals. This is why agents are introduced into the system. Approved by an admin, agents help farmers sell large quantities of products to buyers or shop owners and, in return, earn a commission. This is tracked with commission amounts and payment information. Farmers can hire agents and pay them based on sales, while agents get commissions for helping sell farmer products.
The admin oversees agent approvals and work hours, and also approves agents and monitors major operations in the system, ensuring trust and transparency.
Through FarmLink, we aim to empower farmers, reduce market manipulation, and build a fairer, more direct agricultural market for Bangladesh.


Case Study: FarmLink
FarmLink is a digital agricultural marketplace built using C# .NET that connects farmers in Bangladesh directly with buyers and shop owners, bypassing exploitative middlemen. In this system, users register with roles such as buyer, seller, farmer, or agent. Each seller (who is a user) can list multiple products, specifying attributes like description, unit price, quantity, and image. Buyers can browse and add these products to their cart, and place orders which include product-specific details and are tied to payments. Farmers may assign agents to help them sell products in bulk-these agents are hired by the farmers and must be approved by an admin before operating. Agents earn commissions when they facilitate sales for the farmers. Each agent can be linked to multiple farmers and sales, while each farmer can hire only one agent. Admins play a crucial role in maintaining platform integrity by verifying and approving agents and monitoring major transactions and work hours. The system keeps detailed records of order history, payments, and commissions, ensuring fair trade and transparent operations. This structure promotes fairness and efficiency in the agricultural supply chain by aligning directly with the real-world relationships represented in the FarmLink ER diagram.
